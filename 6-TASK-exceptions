Create a program called "rev2.py" that:

* accepts a command line argument that specifies a file to read
* prints the contents of the file in reverse order (byte by byte, not just by
 line)
* will exit with error code 1 if the specified file does not exist
* will exit with error code 2 if permission is denied to read the file
* will exit with error code 4 if the specified path is not a file

Example:

cat <<EOF>/tmp/foo.txt
Today is the day and
now is
the
time.
EOF

./rev2.py /tmp/foo.txt
.emit

echo $?                              # prints out 0

./rev2.py && echo $?                 # prints 1
./rev2.py /tmp/nofile && echo $?     # prints 1
./rev2.py /root/.bashrc && echo $?   # prints 2 if run as normal user
./rev2.py /lib && echo $?            # prints 4
