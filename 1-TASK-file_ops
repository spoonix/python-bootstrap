Create a script called "reverser.py" that:

* accepts the path to a file as the first argument
* will open the file and print each line it to STDOUT
* prints a blank line
* prints each line of the file in reverse order to STDOUT
* will print "ERROR: No such file" to STDERR if the file does not exist
  or if no argument is provided

** Update:

* update the script to accept the path to the file as the first argument
  passed on the command line
* update the script to exit with a value of "72" if the file does not exist
