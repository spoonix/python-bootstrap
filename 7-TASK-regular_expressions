Using the text of Moby Dick from:

http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701.txt

Write a program that prints out:

- the number of sentences in that start with the uppercase letter 'C'
- the number of lines that start with the uppercase letter 'C'

Punctuation should not count as a character in the string.

Example:

Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears

  This is +1 for both start C and sentence C

nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a
Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction

  This is +1 for both start C, but not sentence

Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What

  This line should be skipped in the count.
