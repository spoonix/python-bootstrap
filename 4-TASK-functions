Create a function called "medianate" that accepts a list of integers and
 returns a list of floating point numbers consisting of the initial integer
 converted to a float and having 0.5 added to it

Create a function "lensort" that will accept a list of strings and will return
 a new list consisting of the strings sorted by ascending order of length.  You 
 may *NOT* use the sort() function to sort the strings.
